##Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains the data science portfolio created by Glen Arch and Shaun Latham\
We shall be working on this portfolio in the weeks to come due to being made redundant along with the majority of our site due to a Pfizer global cost-cutting exercise.\
You can see our progress tracked on Jira at : https://shaun-latham.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DSS/boards/1
##Glen Arch
Recent graduate from Newcastle University, having achieved a First-class degree in Computer Science. I am currently seeking employment in the field of software engineering, following a recent redundancy from Pfizer, where I dedicated 15 months of service before the site's closure. My primary objective is to contribute my skills and knowledge to a company where my work can genuinely make a positive impact on everyday lives.
